# agentic-ai-practice-code
This is a repository of code that I am practicing with for learning how to implement Agentic AI.
The idea behind agentic AI is to allow AI to act autonomously to fulfill goals, while enabling the AI to be adaptive. 
A key component behind implementing agentic AI for automation is to programmatically prompt the AI and to allow for interaction with APIs so AI can act autonomously and carry out its objectives.
